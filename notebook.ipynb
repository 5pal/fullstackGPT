Here's a classic recipe to help you make authentic Italian pizza at home:\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\n*For the dough:*\\n- 2 ½ cups (300g) all-purpose flour or Italian 00 flour (preferred)\\n- 1 teaspoon salt\\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\\n- 1 packet (7g) active dry yeast\\n- ¾ cup (180ml) warm water (about 110°F/45°C)\\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\\n\\n*For the toppings:*\\n- Tomato sauce (preferably made from crushed San Marzano tomatoes)\\n- Fresh mozzarella cheese (preferably mozzarella di bufala or fior di latte)\\n- Fresh basil leaves\\n- Extra virgin olive oil\\n- Salt to taste\\n- Optional toppings: prosciutto, arugula, mushrooms, olives, etc.\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. **Prepare the Dough:**\\n   - In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.\\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.\\n   - Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.\\n   - Mix with a spoon or your hands until a dough forms.\\n   - Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.\\n   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled in size.\\n\\n2. **Preheat the Oven:**\\n   - Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible, typically 475°F to 500°F (250°C to 260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.\\n\\n3. **Shape the Pizza:**\\n   - Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two portions if making smaller pizzas.\\n   - On a floured surface, stretch or roll the dough into a thin circle, about 12 inches in diameter.\\n   - Transfer to a piece of parchment paper or a floured pizza peel if using a pizza stone.\\n\\n4. **Add the Toppings:**\\n   - Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving about 1 inch around the edges.\\n   - Tear or slice the mozzarella and distribute evenly.\\n   - Add fresh basil leaves and drizzle with a little olive oil.\\n   - Season with a pinch of salt.\\n\\n5. **Bake:**\\n   - Transfer the pizza onto a preheated pizza stone or baking sheet.\\n   - Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and crisp, and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.\\n\\n6. **Serve:**\\n   - Remove from the oven, add a few fresh basil leaves if desired, and drizzle with a little more olive oil.\\n   - Slice and enjoy your authentic Italian pizza!\\n\\n**Tips for Authenticity:**\\n- Use high-quality ingredients, especially the tomatoes and mozzarella.\\n- Keep the dough thin and crispy.\\n- Bake at the highest temperature to mimic traditional wood-fired ovens.\\n\\nBuon appetito!\",\n",
